<h2>Brettin Parkin</h2>
<h8>Full-Stack Web Developer/Software Engineer</h8><br>
<h8>A little about me:</h8><br><br>
<h8>I am 28 years old from Lethbridge Alberta. I graduated highschool in Fort macleod in 2012. I went to south carolina on a volleyball scholarship and shortly dropped out. 
I double majored in English and communications, which was a really , really bad idea. After coming home I tried to become self employed editing and writing for freelance websites. It worked for a while, but COVID-19 killed that fast. 
I came back to lethbridge to try school again, and learned I loved software development. Ever since I have been progressing my skills and expanding my knowledge to reach my goals. Currently I am looking for open source projects to lend a hand with 
and to enter challenges and competitions such as what can be found on hackerrank. This is my cat, Bitty. She says thanks for reading!</h8>
